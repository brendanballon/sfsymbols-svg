These files where generated using [this fork](https://github.com/rob-dodson/sfsymbols/tree/UpdateArgParsingAndEnums) of a deprecated command-line tool that can generate SF Symbols in various formats and styles. Note: this repository only includes symbols from SF Symbols 1.1, maybe later I will include the symbols from v2.2.
